A simple PEAR channel frontend that does not require a database.

This package provides a simple frontend to a PEAR channel by directly using
the PEAR channel files.

To use, place the Pyrus_SimpleChannelFrontend .phar in the root of your
channel server as `index.php`, and add an `.htaccess` file with the following:

    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule . index.php [L]
    </IfModule>

For a more customized interface, you can create a `config.inc.php` file, or
install the package and use the files in the `www_dir` as a starting point for
a fully customized PEAR channel. The pear2.php.net uses this method for a 
custom frontend.

Pyrus_SimpleChannelFrontend can also be used as a viewer for remote PEAR
channels. See the `config.sample.php` file for an example of how to do this.
