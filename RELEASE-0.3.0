So glad to announce this release! Many features built for pear2.php.net were
backported so all PEAR channels can benefit. In particular, speed improvements,
release file browsing, and better error handling.

As usual you can grab the new [SCS .phar](http://pear2.php.net/get/PEAR2_SimpleChannelServer-0.3.0.phar),
drop it in your PEAR channel's document root as `index.php` and you're off to
the races.

You can also create a `config.inc.php` file for browsing a remote channel.


See the details for more info!
